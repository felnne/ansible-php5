# Setup Ansible control computer (i.e. localhost)

# This playbook is needed as Ansible won't reload roles between plays.
# By default the 'BARC.prelude' role will be a place-holder which is then replaced by the real role using this play.
# To use this updated, real, role, a new playbook needs to be called, a separate play is not enough.
