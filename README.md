## Quality Assurance

This role uses manual and automated testing to ensure the features offered by this role work as advertised. 
See `tests/README.md` for more information.

## Dependencies

* None

## Requirements

* None

## Limitations

* The PHP version varies depending on which operating system is used and if non-system package sources are permitted

As the package policy varies between system and non-system package sources, and between operating systems, the version 
of PHP installed is variable between supported operating systems.

For Ubuntu machines, a non-system PPA is installed resulting in more recent versions of PHP 5 to be installed. On CentOS 
machines, a non-system repository is installed resulting in more recent versions of PHP 5 to be installed.

It is a convention of BARC roles to use the latest version of packages. Where a suitable non-system package source is 
available it will be used. Otherwise system packages will be used. Suitable non-system packages require a reputable,
maintainer, typically a company or well respected individual. Where non-system packages are used, the variable 
*BARC_use_non_system_package_sources* can be set to `false` to always use system packages if this is needed.

*This limitation is **NOT** considered to be significant. Solutions will **NOT** be actively pursued.*
*Pull requests addressing this limitation will be considered.*

See [BARC-]() for further details.

* On Ubuntu where only system packages are permitted, the 'php5-cli' package is selected, rather than the 'php5' package

The `php5` meta package has dependencies which will, by default, install the Apache web-server. Though this is likely convenient for some, as a generic role, this is completely unsuitable. Other roles can be used to integrate PHP with 
a web-server if that is desired.

See [this source](http://serverfault.com/questions/243297/how-do-you-install-php5-without-installing-apache-in-ubuntu) 
for further details.

*This limitation is considered to be significant. A workaround is in place to mitigate this limitation, pending a*
*permanent resolution by Ubuntu. Pull requests addressing this limitation will be considered.*

See [BARC-]() for further details.

* On CentOS, the PHP configuration file is the same for all SAPIs

CentOS uses a single configuration file, `/etc/php.ini`, for all SAPIs, there is no CLI SAPI specific configuration,
unlike on Ubuntu.

CentOS does support loading configuration files from a directory of configuration files, specifically, 
`/etc/php.d/*.ini`, but these configuration files are included by the main configuration file, and so used by all SAPIs.

*This limitation is considered to be significant. Solutions will be actively pursued. Pull requests to address this* 
*will be gratefully considered and given priority.*

See [BARC-]() for further details.

* Extensions which have been enabled, and later disabled, are not actively disabled on machines this role is applied to

This behaviour relates to how *disabled* applies to extensions managed by this role.

* Where an extension is *enabled* it will be installed, if necessary, and enabled on machines this role is applied to
* Where an extension is *disabled* it will not installed on machines this role is applied to

This means:
* If an extension would not normally be enabled, and is disabled in this role it will remain disabled
* If an extension would normally be enabled, and is disabled in this role it will remain enabled
* Additionally, if an extension would not normally be enabled, is enabled in this role, applied, then disabled and 
applied, it will remain enabled

This is considered acceptable a machines are assumed to be easily replaceable, and so in situations where a previously enabled extension should now be disabled, it is assumed it is acceptable to rebuilt the relevant machines where the 
extension will start disabled.

It is recognised some extensions are initially enabled (by the relevant PHP package, not this role) and that these
extensions cannot therefore be disabled. However disabling these extensions is by definition not typical and therefore 
acceptable to require users to override with their own tasks. If this is needed, this role will not interfere, unless
the relevant extension is enabled in this role. This currently only applies to the Zend OpCache extension.

*This limitation is **NOT** considered to be significant.*
*Solutions will be **NOT** actively pursued as it is intentional.*
*Pull requests to address this will **NOT** be considered.*

See [BARC-]() for further details.

## Usage

### PHP version

Depending on the operating system used, the version of PHP installed will different, though it will be at least PHP 
*5.4*, and not greater than the latest PHP 5 release. The table below hopes to clarify the version you can expect:

| Operating System | Non-System Package Sources Permitted | PHP Version | Notes |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----- |
| Ubuntu           | Yes                                  | *5.6*       | -     |
| Ubuntu           | No                                   | *5.5*       | -     |
| CentOS           | Yes                                  | *5.6*       | -     |
| CentOS           | No                                   | *5.4*       | -     |

Because the exact version installed cannot be guaranteed by this role, you should be careful if using depending on this 
role in another role or a project that relies on PHP. If any version of PHP greater than 5.4 and less than 7.0, is 
acceptable this role is suitable, however where you depend on some feature added to minor releases (e.g. *5.5*) this 
role is unsuitable.

This ambiguity is considered a limitation, see the *limitations* section for more information.

### Non-system packages

It is a convention of BARC roles to use the latest version of packages. Where a suitable non-system package source is 
available it will be used. Suitable non-system packages require a reputable, maintainer, typically a company or well 
respected individual. If this is for some reason unsuitable, it is possible to only use system packages by setting the 
*BARC_use_non_system_package_sources* variable to `false`.

Note: As the package policy varies between system and non-system package sources, and between operating systems, the 
version of installed packages is variable.

Note: On Ubuntu when using system packages only, the `php5-cli` package is selected rather than the `php5` package.
This is considered a limitation, see the *limitations* section for more information.

### PHP configuration files

PHP uses a configuration file to set various options, such as which modules are enabled and how these are configured, 
e.g. which time-zone to use.

This configuration file uses the INI format, which consists of sections containing options with a value. In PHP this
configuration file can be a single file (e.g. `php.ini`) and or a directory of files (e.g. `php.d/*.ini`).

E.g. Core configuration options can be set in a main `php.ini` file, with module specific configuration contained in
per-module configuration files included in the main configuration file.

In addition, configuration options can be set on a per SAPI (Server API) basis. For example settings may differ between
the `cli` SAPI (i.e. the Command Line) and the `apache` SAPI (i.e. a Web Server).

The combination of these various configuration options differ by Operating System, and package used to install PHP.
This variation is considered a limitation, see the *limitations* section for more information.

This role, which configures the `cli` SAPI only, will only configure options relevant to the `cli` SAPI specifically 
(such as a longer execution time). However, on CentOS there is no configuration file limited to the `cli` SAPI, and 
the options set by this role therefore apply to *all* SAPIs. This is considered a limitation, see the *limitations* 
section for more information.

Settings for other SAPIs, such as web-servers, **SHOULD** be set in other roles, or project/purpose specific playbooks.
The tasks used in this role can be used as a template for setting additional options. Providing the Ansible INI module
is used, setting additional INI options will not cause conflicts with this role and so preserve idempotency.

The configuration options set by this role are considered suitably generic and applicable to all situations such that 
they are safe to be used as defaults - however it is accepted there are situations they would not be suitable. They 
include options for:

* Maximum execution time and memory limits
* Default timezone - localised to *Europe/London*
* Error reporting and logging
* Concealing the PHP version for security purposes

See the *php5_sapi_cli_options* variable in the role defaults file (`defaults/main.yml`) for the specific options set.
Where any of these options are unsuitable, override this variable with a copy of these defaults, omitting the unsuitable
options.

### PHP extensions

#### Zend OpCache

"OPcache improves PHP performance by storing precompiled script bytecode in shared memory, thereby removing the need for PHP to load and parse scripts on each request. This extension is bundled with PHP 5.5.0 and later"

Source: http://php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php

This extension is enabled by default - it is controlled by the *php5_use_opcache* variable.

This role configures options for this extension. It is not safe to override options this role sets, however it is safe 
to override the *php5_ext_opcache_options* variable to remove options or change values this role sets.

It is safe to set any other options this role does not outside this role, they will not be overridden.

The following options are set:

* `opcache.fast_shutdown`
  * [OpCache documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/opcache.configuration.php#ini.opcache.fast-shutdown)
  * Enabled for consistency between CentOS and Ubuntu defaults (CentOS wins)
* `opcache.interned_strings_buffer`
  * [OpCache documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/opcache.configuration.php#ini.opcache.interned-strings-buffer)
  * Enabled for consistency between CentOS and Ubuntu defaults (CentOS wins)
* `opcache.max_accelerated_files`
  * [OpCache documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/opcache.configuration.php#ini.opcache.max-accelerated-files)
  * Enabled for consistency between CentOS and Ubuntu defaults (CentOS wins)
* `opcache.memory_consumption`
  * [OpCache documentation](http://php.net/manual/en/opcache.configuration.php#ini.opcache.memory-consumption)
  * Enabled for consistency between CentOS and Ubuntu defaults (CentOS wins)

Note: As the version of PHP installed is inconsistent, this role ensures the OpCache extension is present and enabled in 
all versions of PHP on all supported Operating Systems, where this feature is desired.

Note: If you enable this extension and then later choose to disable it, or where this extension is enabled by default,
such as on Ubuntu, this role will not disable the extension. Instead you will need to re-build any machines this role 
has been applied to.

This is considered a limitation, but by intention and will not be addressed, see the *Limitations* section for more 
information.

#### cURL

"PHP supports libcurl, a library created by Daniel Stenberg, that allows you to connect and communicate to many 
different types of servers with many different types of protocols."

Source: http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php

This extension is enabled by default - it is controlled by the *php5_use_curl* variable.
Currently this role does not configure options for this extension, however it is safe to do this outside this role.

Note: If you enable this extension and then later choose to disable it, or where this extension is enabled by default,
such as on CentOS, this role will not disable the extension. Instead you will need to re-build any machines this role 
has been applied to.

This is considered a limitation, but by intention and will not be addressed, see the *Limitations* section for more 
information.

#### XDebug

"Xdebug is a PHP extension which provides debugging and profiling capabilities. It uses the DBGp debugging protocol."

Source: https://xdebug.org/

This extension is disabled by default - it is controlled by the *php5_use_xdebug* variable.

Important: Enabling this extension introduces additional performance and security considerations. This extension 
**MUST NOT** be enabled in production environments, or in any environment where sensitive information is involved,
unless these considerations are suitably addressed.

This role configures options for this extension. It is not safe to override options this role sets, however it is safe 
to override the *php5_ext_xdebug_options* variable to remove options or change values this role sets.

It is safe to set any other options this role does not outside this role, they will not be overridden.

The following options are set:

* `xdebug.remote_connect_back`
  * [XDebug documentation](https://xdebug.org/docs/all_settings#remote_connect_back)
  * Enabled to allow any machine to debug a session - note this has security implications meaning this extension 
    **MUST NOT** be used in production environments
* `xdebug.remote_enable`
  * [XDebug documentation](https://xdebug.org/docs/all_settings#remote_enable)
  * Instructs XDebug to contact potentially listening remote clients, or otherwise continue with normal execution

Note: If you enable this extension and then later choose to disable it, this role will not disable the extension.
Instead you will need to re-build any machines this role has been applied to.

This is considered a limitation, but by intention and will not be addressed, see the *Limitations* section for more 
information.
